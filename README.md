This is an interactive Sports Quiz where users can test their knowledge. The game fetches questions from the external Open Trivia DB API and dynamically displays them using JavaScript. It utilizes modern JavaScript features such as arrow functions and the spread operator, as well as CSS Flexbox and animations for the layout.

The best scores are stored in the browser's Local Storage to preserve them for future games. The game also includes a spinning loading icon that appears while questions are being loaded.
